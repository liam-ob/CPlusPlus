## How to use this

1. Install a C++ compiler (look up a video bro)
2. Open a command prompt
3. navigate to wherever you have the file with `cd <path goes here>`
4. build it with `g++ -o s2e.exe s2e.cpp -ladvapi32 -luser32 -lgdi32 -lshell32 -mwindows`
5. create a shortcut of the `s2e.exe` file that was just made
6. Press `Windows Key + R` and type `shell:startup` in the little window that popped up
7. Place the shortcut you made earlier

Boom!
You now have a shake to enlarge mouse script that will run every time you start your computer and can be exitted by right clicking the system tray icon!
